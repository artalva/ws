    <p><em>I feel weak right now.</em></p>
<p>It’s been nearly two weeks since I came back from Poland. My purpose was to <strong>work.</strong> I was set on getting a job and starting an online business. This in order to have money and a stable income by the time I went back to Martyna. As of right now, I don’t have a job nor have I made <strong>a single step</strong> towards that online business. I feel weak.</p>
<p>I am afraid and lazy; I procrastinate. Today, after listening to Elliott Hulse and the <a href="https://invidio.us/watch?v=rWggjRlfpR4">12 commandments from his father</a>, it dawns on me just how weak I really am. Where is my command? I have set the path, but I haven’t managed to give the first step. How do I force myself to do it, do move forward. Where is the discipline I thought I had built? I felt strong and capable back in Poland, after a streak of successes and major achievements in my life. That confidence is slowly fading as I see myself completely lacking all action right now. All I do is think, I don’t act.</p>
<p>I keep imagining in my head how things are going to be; what it’ll be like after I have achieved my goals. I keep telling myself I can do it: “You’re smart,” “you’re capable,” “it’ll be easy for you.”  It’s so attractive, but I don’t move towards it. As I write this I think, maybe I should envision myself working instead; doing the things that I don’t want to do or that I’m afraid of. This might turn more effective in making that first step.</p>
<p>Why though is it so difficult to make that first step? I look for excuses, I run away, even whilst thinking about what I should be doing instead. I even stooped as low as to turn on the old PlayStation to game my productivity away. Though that didn’t last long, and my embarrassment forced me to turn it off shortly after I turned it on, the fact that I would even start to do such a thing just to avoid working is&hellip; scary.</p>
<h2 id="strength">Strength.</h2>
<p><em>I must become strong—physically and mentally.</em></p>
<p>“If you’re not strong, you’re weak.” This is a phrase Elliott mentioned. I can’t force myself to act right now. I am therefore not strong yet. I’m not as weak as before. I have achieved plenty this past year. It’s true that Tina pushed me to start doing, but I did. Within days I (1) got a job and began earning money, then (2) moved out of the house and became independent, (3) managed to save all the necessary money, prepare the documents, and be ready to (4) finally meet Martyna, one of the major milestones in my life. Continuing that I (5) lived for months in a foreign land and even (6) nailed an interview and got an offer from a firm to work there. That last one didn’t work, but not because of myself. I have accomplished a lot. I can do it.</p>
<p>Just compare everything that was done in the last 365 days to the average person’s life. It’s quite a lot more crazy than simply going to work, or even starting an own business, store, self employment. Many who have done all of these would be intimidated by the idea of everything I did, yet I did it. It’s clear I have what it takes, now I have to take action.</p>
<h3 id="action">Action.</h3>
<p>Taking action requires more than just words, it requires action in itself. Where to start? I don’t have to start with just the business. I have to take action in different ways. Exercising, learning, devoting myself to family and spirit. There are many small, quick noble actions I can take every day, every hour of the day. Identify these, and take action.</p>
<h3 id="plan">Plan.</h3>
<p>Plans&hellip; I’ve had a plan since before coming here. I didn’t follow any of it. True, I tried to get a job, but I didn’t work hard on it, and in the end it didn’t come and I ended up giving up on it. What will make the next plan any different? Small steps.</p>
<p>Does having small steps guarantee I will follow them? Hell no. But fuck, I have to try. How many more things will I write before I actually fucking do something? I am becoming more disillusioned in myself, but I can’t be trapped by melancholy. That vicious desire to victimize myself and be self-pitying. There’s some disgusting satisfaction in that feeling. No, I must not fall prey to it.</p>
<p>That’s not to say this isn’t time to panic; it is. Get off your ass and do something. Get up and work; literally. Get up, and start working. Don’t go looking for anything else. Just wake up, and start working somehow. This is the plan. What is work? Everything that builds towards our goals.</p>
<p><strong>Live</strong>; follow the Wim Hof method. <strong>Lift</strong>; follow Convict Conditioning. <strong>Work</strong>; follow Ramit Sethi’s courses. <strong>Love</strong>; follow Stefan Molyneux’s relationship advice. <strong>Read</strong>; once you are tired and can’t do anything well anymore, read and learn from the many books you have on the queue until you fall asleep to rest.</p>
<p>Once again: <strong>Live. Lift. Work. Love. Read.</strong></p>
<p>This is the plan, a new conviction, and it starts now. It’s almost 21:00 on the clock, but I’m not going to go to bed until I’ve done all the 5 words of the day. Everyday, no bed until I have done all the 5 words of the day.</p>
<p>This cleared up a couple of things, but as always I must start moving. There’s nothing more. Better luck to myself with this plan. Godspeed.</p>
